# 🔋 Energy Needs: A Data Science Exploration 🔍

## 🌍 Overview

The "Energy Needs" project dives deep into the world of energy capacities and consumptions across nations. By leveraging data, we aim to uncover countries at the forefront of potential energy challenges. Through rigorous analysis, this project pinpoints nations that might face energy shortfalls by contrasting their present energy infrastructure with forecasted demands rooted in historical patterns.

## 🎯 Objectives

1. 📊 Analyze energy capacity and consumption datasets from various countries.
2. 📈 Establish consumption trends over past years and project future demands.
3. 🔍 Identify nations most likely to encounter energy deficits in the near future.
4. 🚀 Provide actionable insights for policymakers and stakeholders.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

- **Data Collection**: Web scraping tools, APIs from global energy databases.
- **Data Analysis**: Python, Pandas, Numpy.
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau.
- **Machine Learning (for projections)**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow.

## 📚 Data Sources

- [Global Electricity Statistics (1980-2021)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akhiljethwa/global-electricity-statistics)

## 📝 Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Gather data from multiple sources to ensure comprehensiveness.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Preprocess and cleanse the data to ensure accuracy and reliability.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Understand patterns, outliers, and distributions in the dataset.
4. **Trend Analysis**: Analyze historical data to determine energy consumption trends.
5. **Predictive Modeling**: Use machine learning models to project future energy consumption.
6. **Insight Generation**: Extract and document critical findings from the analysis.
